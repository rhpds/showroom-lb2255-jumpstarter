= Red Hat Automotive Development Platform

https://developers.redhat.com/rhdh/overview[Red Hat Developer Hub] sits at the core of the Red Hat Automotive Development Platform (RHADP), 
creating an integrated ecosystem for software-defined vehicle development. Think of it as your central command center where you and your team can:

- Access pre-configured tools and standardized workflows without the usual setup headaches
- Leverage automated testing processes that maintain compliance with automotive safety standards
- Use familiar Linux-based tools that feel like home to developers 

The platform's cloud integration isn't just buzzword compliance—it gives you genuinely scalable testing environments and supports rapid 
prototyping when you need to validate concepts quickly.


== Solution architecture

At its heart, RHADP combines Red Hat Developer Hub with Red Hat Dev Spaces to give you instant access to fully-configured development environments. 

This Internal Development Platform (IDP) is built on the open-source https://backstage.spotify.com/[Backstage] project and comes ready 
with all the tools, extensions, and configurations you need through a single dashboard. 

This approach means:

- Your team starts coding immediately instead of wrestling with environment setup
- You maintain consistent security and governance practices across teams
- Development processes follow standardized patterns while still allowing for innovation
- Environment-related issues become a thing of the past

The diagram below provides an overview of the RHADP architecture:

== Development workflow

The development workflow follows a structured yet flexible path from initial code creation to final deployment. 

As a developer, when you start your day, you'll access your cloud workspace and pull the latest code base. Behind the scenes, the 
platform automatically processes your metadata (Infrastructure-as-Code) to configure your development environment with exactly 
what you need (GitOps principles in action).

As you code, continuous validation and testing processes run in the background, giving you immediate feedback about code quality, 
security vulnerabilities, and potential issues. This DevSecOps approach means you'll catch problems early when they're 
easier and cheaper to fix, rather than discovering them during final testing.

Your code undergoes multiple layers of validation through a comprehensive testing strategy. It starts with cloud-based testing 
environments to verify basic functionality and integration with other components. This is where most common issues are caught and resolved quickly.

From there, your code progresses to testing on virtual hardware, where you can observe how it behaves in a simulated automotive environment. 
Finally, Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing connects your software to actual automotive components (SoCs) in controlled conditions, 
giving you confidence that your code will perform as expected in real vehicles.

Key Components:

- OpenShift Pipelines and OpenShift GitOps for continuous integration and deployment
- https://pipelinesascode.com/[Pipelines as Code] for defining your CI/CD workflows as code
- OpenShift Dev Spaces for consistent, cloud-based development environments
- https://jumpstarter.dev/[Jumpstarter] for automated testing across virtual and physical hardware

== Virtual and Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing

Virtual testing and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing are essential methods in modern automotive software development. 
With virtual testing, you can validate vehicle systems through sophisticated simulations, eliminating the need for physical 
prototypes in early development stages. 

This approach significantly reduces development costs and time while allowing you to test edge cases that might be dangerous or impractical to test with real hardware.

HIL testing takes validation to the next level by connecting actual vehicle hardware components (e.g. ECUs, sensors, and 
actuators) to a cloud platform that creates a controlled test environment. This hybrid approach gives you the 
best of both worlds: the safety and reproducibility of cloud environments with the confidence that comes from testing on real hardware. 

[#jumpstarter]
=== Jumpstarter

Jumpstarter seamlessly integrates with your HIL testing environment, serving as the bridge between your CI/CD pipeline and physical hardware testing. 
This https://github.com/jumpstarter-dev[open source] tool automates the deployment of your software to both virtual environments and actual 
automotive hardware components, maintaining consistent testing conditions throughout your development process. 

By incorporating Jumpstarter into your workflow, you'll eliminate the traditional disconnect between software development and hardware 
validation, allowing your HIL tests to become a natural extension of your continuous integration process rather than a separate, manual testing phase.
