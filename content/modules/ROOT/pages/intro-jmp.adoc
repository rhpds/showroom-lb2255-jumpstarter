= Jumpstarter

Automated testing with physical hardware (Hardware-in-the-Loop or HiL) and virtual devices has been established for years in industries such as 
automotive and manufacturing. However, these tools are often expensive and inaccessible to hobbyists and open source projects.

Jumpstarter provides powerful testing tools that leverage https://www.cncf.io/[Cloud Native] principles, modern CI/CD technologies, and open standards for 
the next generation of edge devices, whether physical or emulated.


For a detailed technical overview of the architecture, see the https://docs.jumpstarter.dev/architecture.html[Jumpstarter Architecture] documentation.

[#jmp_components]
== Core components

Jumpstarter consists of the following core components:

- https://docs.jumpstarter.dev/introduction/clients.html[Clients] - Python library and CLI tools that allow you to
  interact with your devices
- https://docs.jumpstarter.dev/introduction/drivers.html[Drivers] - Modular interfaces that define how to interact with
  specific hardware or virtual interfaces
- https://docs.jumpstarter.dev/introduction/adapters.html[Adapters] - Components that transform driver connections into
  different forms or interfaces for specific use cases
- https://docs.jumpstarter.dev/introduction/exporters.html[Exporters] - Services that expose device interfaces using
  drivers
- https://docs.jumpstarter.dev/introduction/service.html[Service] - Kubernetes-based controller that manages device
  access

[#jmp_relationships]
== Key component relationships

The relationship between these components is important to understand:

- **Drivers and Adapters**: Drivers establish and manage the basic connections to hardware or virtual interfaces, while adapters transform these 
connections into different forms without modifying the underlying driver. This separation creates a flexible architecture where 
drivers focus on core functionality and adapters enhance usability for specific scenarios.

- **Exporters and Drivers**: Exporters use drivers to expose device interfaces to clients. The exporter loads driver implementations 
based on configuration and makes them available over the network.

- **Clients and Exporters**: Clients connect to exporters to access and control the devices. In local mode, this happens directly, 
while in distributed mode, this is managed by the central controller.

Together, these components form a layered architecture that separates concerns and allows for a flexible, extensible testing system.

[#jmp_development]
== Development environment

Since Jumpstarter's core components are written in Python, they can run almost
anywhere. This means that you can set up a test lab with physical hardware or
emulated devices (using tools like QEMU), while still using the same Linux-based
CI systems you currently host in the cloud.

Jumpstarter integrates seamlessly with the existing ecosystem of Python testing
tools such as https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/[pytest]. You can also use the
Jumpstarter CLI directly from shell scripts and Makefiles allowing you to write
simple automation scripts easily.

In addition to testing, Jumpstarter can also act as a KVM (Keyboard, Video,
Mouse) switch - a hardware device that allows multiple computers to share a
single set of input/output devices. Similarly, Jumpstarter enables developers to
remotely access and control both physical and virtual devices for ad-hoc
development whether they are sitting at the next desk or working remotely.

[#jmp_operation_modes]
== Operation modes

Jumpstarter can be used in either a *local-only* or *distributed* environment
depending on your development needs.

=== Local-Only mode

When using Jumpstarter locally, you can develop drivers, write automated tests,
and control your devices directly from your development machine without
additional infrastructure.

The *local-only mode* is useful when:

- Working with hardware on your desk or virtual devices that you have unlimited
  access to
- Developing and testing drivers for new hardware or emulated environments
- Creating initial test automation scripts
- Using QEMU or other virtualization tools to emulate target devices

For details on how this mode works, see the https://docs.jumpstarter.dev/architecture.html#local-mode[Running Tests
Locally] section in the architecture
documentation.

=== Distributed mode

As your project grows, Jumpstarter helps you collaborate across teams, implement
CI/CD pipelines, and automate common tasks such as firmware updates.

The *distributed mode* leverages https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] to support
the management of multiple devices (physical or virtual) directly from your
existing cluster. This allows for seamless integration with many existing Cloud
Native technologies such as https://tekton.dev[Tekton], https://argoproj.github.io/cd/[ArgoCD], and
https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/[Prometheus].

The distributed mode is ideal when:

- Multiple teams need access to shared hardware or virtual device resources
- Continuous integration requires scheduled tests on physical or emulated
  devices
- Test environments are distributed across multiple locations
- Devices (physical or virtual) need to be managed remotely
