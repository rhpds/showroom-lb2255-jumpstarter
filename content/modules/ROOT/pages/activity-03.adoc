= Testing and Validation

While Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces provides a consistent environment for developing, building, and testing automotive applications,
comprehensive validation requires testing on virtual or physical hardware to ensure stability, performance, and compatibility across target platforms.

== Overview
In this activity, we will build a RHIVOS image with our application embedded, preparing it for end-to-end testing in
virtualized hardware environments using Jumpstarter, by:

- Taking the `develop` branch that we created in the previous activity, and propose a merge request to the `main` branch.
- Understanding how the pipelines build the RHIVOS image and perform testing with Jumpstarter in virtual hardware.

== Create a Merge Request

Create a merge request to merge your changes from the `⁠develop` branch into the ⁠main branch. To perform this
we should go to the gitlab interface and select the `develop` branch. Click on the *Merge Request* button to create a new merge request.

We can get to the GitLab interface by clicking on the View source of our component in the Red Hat Developer Hub dashboard:

{rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/{username}-jumpstarter-lab[window=_blank]

once there, click on the *View source* link:

Once in the GitLab interface, we should select the `develop` branch and click on the *Merge Request* button,

Merge requests are a way to propose changes to the codebase. They allow for code review, discussion, and **automated testing** before merging changes into the main branch,
let's create it by clicking on the *Create Merge Request* button:

By creating a merge request a different pipeline will be triggered, in this case, the one contained in `.tekton/tasks/pr-build-test.yaml`.

If we go to the CI tab in our component in backstage, or just the links in the GitLab merge request comments we can see the pipelines running:

Looking in detail, this pipeline performs the following steps, some in parallel:

- `fetch-repository`: Clones the repository and checks out the *develop* branch from our merge request.
- `prepare-jumpstarter-config`: Prepares the Jumpstarter configuration files for authenticating to the Jumpstarter service.
- `build-container`: Builds and pushes the container image for our application using the *Containerfile* located in the *src* directory.
- `tag-container`: Tags the container image as *latest*.
- `prepare-build`: Validates the RHIVOS automotime image builder definition in *.aib-ci.yaml* and prepares the build environment.
- `automotive-image-builder`: Builds the RHIVOS image using the *automotive-image-builder tool*, which is a part of the Red Hat In-Vehicle OS (RHIVOS) project.
- `create-jumpstarter-lease`: Requests and waits for a Jumpstarter exporter lease, the leased device (or virtual device) will be used for testing in the following tasks.
- `flash-with-jumpstarter`: Flashes the RHIVOS image to the leased device using Jumpstarter.
- `test-with-jumpstarter`: Runs the defined test cases in the *tests* directory of our project on the flashed device.
- `release`: Finishes the lease and releases the device back to Jumpstarter.
- `s3-upload`: Uploads the built image to an *S3 bucket* for interactive, we will use this on the next.

== Release deployment pipeline

After successful testing, create a "release" by merging the ⁠develop branch into the ⁠main branch. This triggers the deployment pipeline that:

- Builds the production-ready RHIVOS image optimized for your specific hardware platform
- Uses Jumpstarter to flash the image directly to the physical hardware
- Uses Jumpstarter to run the defined test cases on the physical hardware

NOTE: The release pipeline focuses on hardware testing rather than virtual testing, assuming all validation has been completed in the development pipeline. *An good alternative* is to always use physical devices on merge requests if your lab has sufficient resources,
      this way you can validate the code on hardware before merging it to the main branch.

NOTE: Due to the limited availability of physical hardware in this lab, we will only show this on screen, but the participant pipelines will still test on virtual hardware.

== Next

Now that we've completed the development workflow, we'll explore advanced Jumpstarter capabilities including:

- Manual interaction with hardware for development and troubleshooting
- Writing custom test cases for your specific application requirements
